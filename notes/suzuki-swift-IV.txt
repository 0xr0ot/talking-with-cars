Suzuki Swift IV AZG 1.3 DDiS 16V 75cv
=====================================

## UDS Authentication

The Suzuki Swift answers to UDS security session, and when asked for a seed
it sends a 2 bytes seed, which is always the same (#TODO: specify here the
two bytes seed, I forgot it).

We must restart the diagnostic session before retrying any security
authentication or the bruteforce is broken by exceedNumberOfAttempts (0x36) or
requiredTimeDelayNotExpired (0x37) errors.

We are still more or less bruteforcing it right now :) (sleep(5) minimum
required god dammit)

## CAN broadcasted messages reverse engineering

0x120[1:2]: rpm
0x122[1:2]: accelerator pedal pressure
0x13f[1:2]: rpm

0x1af[0]: maybe ABS (flips betwween 0x1 and 0x81 when hard breaking, else 0)
0x1af[6:7]: brakes pedal pressure

0x318[0]: No brakes (0x1), braking (0x5)

0x3a1[0]: maybe ABS (flips between multiple values when hard breaking, else 0)

0x3d0[0]: Lights off (0x00), on (0x20)
0x3d0[1]: handbrake down (0x00), up (0x40)
0x3d0[2]: Bitvector:
          - Defrost off (0x00), on (0x04) (bit 2)
          - Lights off (0x00), on (0x08)  (bit 3)
0x3d0[4]: Hazard lights (blinks, so flips between 0x00 and the following values)
          - 0x40: Left hazard light is on
          - 0x80: Right hazard light is on
          - 0xC0: Both hazard ligths are on

0x3d1[0]: Doors open:
          - 0x01: Left front door open
          - 0x02: Right front door open
          - 0x03: Both front door open
0x3d1[2]: Doors lock:
          - 0x00: Both front doors unlock
          - 0x15: Left front door only unlock
          - 0x55: Both front doors lock
